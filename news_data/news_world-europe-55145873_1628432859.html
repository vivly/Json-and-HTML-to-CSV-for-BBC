He spent his early life in one of Ireland&#x27;s infamous Church-run, state-funded mother and baby homes, St Patrick&#x27;s on the Navan Road. At that time, most unmarried women didn&#x27;t keep their children. The stigma made it impossible to get a job or rent a flat, and there was no state support available for women in this situation. </p></div></div><div data-component="image-block" class="ssrcss-mxs2fu-ComponentWrapper e1xue1i810"><figure class="ssrcss-md0xev-StyledFigure e34k3c23"><div class="ssrcss-ab5fd8-StyledFigureContainer e34k3c21"><span class="ssrcss-1r10xen-Placeholder e16icw910"><span><noscript><img alt="Conrad Bryan as a boy" srcSet="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/14CC1/production/_115758158_z1400conradarchives.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/14CC1/production/_115758158_z1400conradarchives.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/14CC1/production/_115758158_z1400conradarchives.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/14CC1/production/_115758158_z1400conradarchives.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/14CC1/production/_115758158_z1400conradarchives.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/14CC1/production/_115758158_z1400conradarchives.jpg 976w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/14CC1/production/_115758158_z1400conradarchives.jpg" width="1536" height="864.5485714285714" loading="lazy" class="ssrcss-1drmwog-Image ee0ct7c0"/></noscript></span></span><span class="ssrcss-1ecljvk-StyledFigureCopyright e34k3c20"><span class="ssrcss-1f39n02-VisuallyHidden e1y6uwnp0">image source</span>Conrad Bryan</span></div></figure></div><div data-component="text-block" class="ssrcss-5rhf4g-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i87"><div class="ssrcss-18snukc-RichTextContainer e5tfeyi1"><p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Conrad&#x27;s father was one of many African students who had come to study in Dublin. In the 1960s, the Irish government ran schemes supporting them in learning skills that would help them build up their own newly independent states. Most enrolled in Trinity College, University College Dublin, and the Royal College of Surgeons, studying subjects like medicine, law, and government administration. By 1962, at least 1,100 students - or one tenth of Ireland&#x27;s student population - were African, from countries like Nigeria, Ghana and South Africa, where there were strong links with Irish missionaries. </p></div></div><div data-component="text-block" class="ssrcss-5rhf4g-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i87"><div class="ssrcss-18snukc-RichTextContainer e5tfeyi1"><p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">By 1967, an Irish military college had accepted a delegation of Zambian cadets. &quot;It&#x27;s natural… that Zambia&#x27;s young officials would be trained in a small independent country like Ireland, a country with no history of imperialism,&quot; a TV news report said at the time. </p></div></div><div data-component="text-block" class="ssrcss-5rhf4g-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i87"><div class="ssrcss-18snukc-RichTextContainer e5tfeyi1"><p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">But the students weren&#x27;t always welcomed by the wider population. News articles reported attacks on African students and mentioned &quot;difficult landladies&quot; - a reference to housing discrimination, according to Dr Bryan Fanning, author of Migration and the Making of Ireland. Though some of the students had relationships with Irish women, it was rare that these led to marriage in the culture of the time. </p></div></div><div data-component="text-block" class="ssrcss-5rhf4g-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i87"><div class="ssrcss-18snukc-RichTextContainer e5tfeyi1"><p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Many of the children from these relationships spent their early lives in mother-and-baby homes and were placed for adoption. Irish adoptions at the time were carried out under a closed system - where there is no contact or sharing of information between the adopted child and the natural parents.  To this day, adopted people do not have a statutory right to their early life files. Others, like Conrad, who were not adopted, were transferred to orphanages. For a child born outside marriage, their father&#x27;s name would not typically have appeared on their birth certificate. </p></div></div><div data-component="text-block" class="ssrcss-5rhf4g-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i87"><div class="ssrcss-18snukc-RichTextContainer e5tfeyi1"><p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Some have spent years trying to discover their heritage. </p></div></div><div id="piano-inline2"></div><div data-component="image-block" class="ssrcss-mxs2fu-ComponentWrapper e1xue1i810"><figure class="ssrcss-md0xev-StyledFigure e34k3c23"><div class="ssrcss-ab5fd8-StyledFigureContainer e34k3c21"><span class="ssrcss-1iqsg44-Placeholder e16icw910"><span><noscript><img alt="Short presentational grey line" srcSet="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/72FB/production/_112953492__90021446_test_grey_line_new-nc.png 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/72FB/production/_112953492__90021446_test_grey_line_new-nc.png 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/72FB/production/_112953492__90021446_test_grey_line_new-nc.png 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/72FB/production/_112953492__90021446_test_grey_line_new-nc.png 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/72FB/production/_112953492__90021446_test_grey_line_new-nc.png 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/72FB/production/_112953492__90021446_test_grey_line_new-nc.png 976w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/72FB/production/_112953492__90021446_test_grey_line_new-nc.png" width="624" height="23" loading="lazy" class="ssrcss-1drmwog-Image ee0ct7c0"/></noscript></span></span></div></figure></div><div data-component="text-block" class="ssrcss-5rhf4g-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i87"><div class="ssrcss-18snukc-RichTextContainer e5tfeyi1"><p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">In the late 1980s, Conrad had grown tired of being called names.
