In November it made up around a quarter of cases in London. This reached nearly two-thirds of cases in mid-December.\nThree things are coming together that mean it is attracting attention:\nIt is rapidly replacing other versions of the virus\nIt has mutations that affect part of the virus likely to be important\nSome of those mutations have already been shown in the lab to increase the ability of the virus to infect cells\nAll of these come together to build a case for a virus that can spread more easily. However, we do not have absolute certainty. New strains can become more common simply by being in the right place at the right time - such as London.\nThis variant is unusually highly mutated. The most likely explanation is it emerged in a patient with a weakened immune system that was unable to beat the virus.\nThere is no evidence yet to suggest the variant makes the infection more deadly, and at least for now the developed vaccines will almost certainly work against it.\nHowever, if the virus changes so it dodges the full effect of the vaccine, then \"vaccine escape\" happens, and this may be the most concerning element.\nYou may also find interesting\nmedia caption BBC Middle East correspondent Yolande Knell joins rehearsals for the festive processions that are still going ahead in Bethlehem\nHow are the new restrictions affecting you?
